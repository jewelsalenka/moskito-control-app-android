    <p>MoSKito-Control App shows the status of your application, reporting the current health state of its components.</p>
    <p>Being the mobile part of MoSKito-Control, the App is simple yet very effective. This is how everything is set up:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Your application</b> does its work,</li>
            <li><b>MoSKito-Essential</b> collects performance data from your application,</li>
            <li><b>MoSKito-Control WebApp (Server)</b> fetches the needed data from <b>MoSKito-Essential</b>,</li>
            <li><b>MoSKito-Control App</b> receives data from MoSKito-Control <b>WebApp</b> and gracefully displays it on your iOS device.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>As a result, you see the major performance indicators of your application at any moment, without accessing your workstation.</p>
